# Game Info

Name: Red Pill Hunter
Type: Arcade FPS

Description:
Red Pill Hunter is a minimalist, one-level FPS built in Unity URP for Windows. 
In this game, a single shot is lethalâ€”both for the player and the enemies. 
You switch between a ranged pistol and a melee katana, each offering distinct combat approaches. 
Enemies, represented by simple capsule models, use basic AI via Unity's NavMesh to reposition and engage the player when in line-of-sight. 
With fast restarts and a focus on precision combat, Red Pill Hunter challenges you to stay alert and make every move count.

Instructions:
You will start immediately at the arena so look out for enemies approaching!

The goal of the game is to clear off the arena.

Controls:

WASD to move
Space to jump
LMB for attacking
1, 2 for switching weapons

The player has 2 weapons for their survival, a pistol and a katana.

'1' is assigned to the Pistol
'2' is assigned to the Katana

You can switch between the two any time.

Reloading is handled automatically. You can pick up ammo from your enemies' guns.

All attacks that land on the enemies will kill them instantly. 

BUT the same goes for you as well.

Good luck!
